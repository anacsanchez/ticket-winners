    "description": "A Valentine's meal leaves Harold with some startling questions about his past, and he sets off to chilly Falmouth to find some answers. At first the people of Falmouth are smart and hopeful. He is intrigued by the curiously virtuous actor, Josh Jones. However, after he introduces him to hard coffee, Harold slowly finds himself drawn into a web of adultery, sloth and perhaps, even abduction. Can Harold resist the charms of Josh Jones and uncover the secret of the enchanted gun before it's too late, or will his demise become yet another Falmouth legend?",
